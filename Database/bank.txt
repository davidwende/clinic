Hello Bank Leumi

I am a reasonably satisfied customer of yours for well over 20 years.
Unfortunately I must now reconsider where I do my banking.
This is in light of the recent political action by Bank Leumi to freeze the
accounts of several residents of Judea / Sumaria in heed of a call by
a foreign nation.

I regret to inform you that unless the bank rescinds this decision within several days
I will be moving my account elsewhere.

Yours,
David Wende
